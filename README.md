# JSONRpcDevice
ads-tec device API Java library based on JSON RPC

All ads-tec products of the IRF2000, IWL3000 or SRC1000 series provide an API communication with the device directly on target between the OSGi™ environment and the base system. The API is based on the JSON RPC 2.0 standard.
	
With this API it is possible:
•	To access and change all configuration options. 
•	Gather current state information like IP addresses, 3G link state or whatever is of importance
•	Control several device dependent systems like the battery control on the SRC1000, the wireless roaming control on the IWL3000 or the VPN and Big-LinX control on the IRF2000.
